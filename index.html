        <h1>Legalize Dance NYC!</h1>
        <p>Did you know that it is unlawful for more than three people to dance in any place that sells food or drink in New York, unless the business acquires a specific license?</p>
        <p>
          Legalize Dance NYC is an informal organization commited to making sure the New York city council repeals the archaic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Cabaret_Law">Cabaret Law</a>. It was originally passed to try to penalize the Harlem Renaissance, parts have already been struck down as illegally discriminatory, and there is an ongoing 1st Amendment challenge against it. And while it doesn't limit how loudly bars can blast their music, it does make it illegal to dance in a restaurant or bar that doesn't have license.
