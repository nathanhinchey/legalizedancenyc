    <h1>Legalize Dance NYC!</h1>
    <p>
      We are an informal organization commited to making sure the New York city council repeals the archaic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Cabaret_Law">Cabaret Law</a>.

    <p>
      According to Wikipedia:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>New York City Cabaret Law</b> is an actively-enforced dancing ban originally enacted in 1926 during Prohibition in the United States. The New York City Cabaret Law refers to the prohibition of dancing in all NYC spaces open to the public that sell food and/or drink with the exception of those who obtain a cabaret license. It prohibits dancing by more than three persons in any "room, place or space" in New York City that lacks a cabaret license, and prohibits "musical entertainment, singing, dancing or other form of amusement" without a license. <b>Critics argue that the license is expensive and difficult to obtain while enforcement is arbitrary and has historically been weaponized against marginalized groups</b>, while its proponents insist the law minimizes noise complaints.
